This is for new files added and changes to code.
New file added. Glide-distance-estimator-C.cpp
It is a C++ file mostly in C.
It may or may not work on all compilers.
November 2 2024.
Glide distance estimator2.cpp was added.
It puts user input in a while loop and uses
.find() and does not require a std::out_of_range
exception.
Becouse the code is more complicated the original
was left.
November 3 2024.
Glide distance estimator2.cpp had a while loop added to
altitude. A valid altitude must be entered to continue.
All C++ files were formatted for easier reading.
