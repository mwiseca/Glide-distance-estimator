# Glide-distance-estimator
Estimates the straight line glide distance of a aircraft from a given altitude.
DO NOT USE THIS PROGRAM IN ACTUAL AVIATION.
This program was ment to be used with aircraft tracking websites and
flight simulator games only.
This program gives a rough estimate of glide distance.
In the map replace aircraft a, b, c, ect with aircraft you want 
to follow with the corresponding glide ratios. The program asks to enter a aircraft
than a altitude.
Than gives a rough estimate of the straight line glide distance in miles.
